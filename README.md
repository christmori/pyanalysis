# Data Analysis Example

This repository contains a simple Python script for data analysis. The script uses the pandas and matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize fictitious sales data of different products over a period of time.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```

3. View the generated charts and explore the data analysis results.

## Dataset

The dataset is fictitious and includes columns such as 'Date', 'Product A', 'Product B', and 'Product C'. The script performs basic data analysis and generates a chart showing the sales trends of each product over time.

Feel free to modify the script or dataset according to your needs.
